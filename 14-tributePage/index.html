        <h2>Ahilya Bai Holkar's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ahilyabai Holkar was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi,
            in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra.
          </li>
          <li>She was married to Khanderao Holkar in 1735.</li>
          <li>
            In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao. Malerao was mentally
            unwell and died of his illness in 1767.
          </li>
          <li>Her husband was killed during the siege of Kumher in 1754.</li>
          <li>
            After his death in 1754, his father Malhar Rao prevented his wife
            Ahilya Bai from committing sati.
          </li>
          <li>
            Malhar Rao Holkar died in 1766, 12 years after the death of his son
            Khanderao.
          </li>
          <li>
            Malhar Rao's grandson and Khanderao's only son Malerao Holkar became
            the ruler of Indore in 1766, under the regentship of Ahilyabai, but
            he too died within few months on 5 April 1767.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ahilyabai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her son
            Khanderao.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of
            Holkar supported her leadership.
          </li>
          <li>
            Among Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from
            a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital,
            however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada
            river.
          </li>
          <li>
            She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and
            gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and
            rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to
            pilgrimage centres in South India.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ahilyabai died on 13 August 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern
            times, Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore's
            and India's history.
